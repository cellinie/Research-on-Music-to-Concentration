# Research on Music to Concentration

This study involved 41 university students from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, chosen via stratified random sampling to represent introvert and extrovert subgroups. The choice of CUHKSZ was intentional due to its diverse student population, including both international and Chinese students. The data were collected using a mixed method that combined quantitative surveys via Microsoft Forms, providing ordinal data, and qualitative thematic analysis of open-ended responses. Statistical tools such as Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS were employed for data analysis, including descriptive analysis and ordinal regression. Furthermore, the thematic data analysis used in vivo coding to illustrate the point that different languages and cultures of the students can view the same things differently and avoid interpretation errors.
